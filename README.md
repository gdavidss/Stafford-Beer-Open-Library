- *[Decision and Control (1966)](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=A80EAFDB95CC2A07CD70B1270A3258F3)*

    - **Description:** Presents the basic approaches underlying Stafford Beer's thinking since the publication of his first book in 1959. Deals with a philosophy of science relevant to management and particularly with the nature of models. Demonstrates all major points through examples quoted of management science applications to industry and government.

- *[Management Science (1968)](https://b-ok.cc/book/21058678/d9fd9b)* [NO DOWNLOAD LINK -- Help us!]

    - **Description:** The management of complex enterprises, in government, in business, or in the military services, is certainly the most important practical activity in which individual men engage. Yet it is one of the most recent to seek assistance directly from the formal apparatus of science. In this book one of the pioneers in the field tells something of the occasion for, and the methods and achievements of, the scientific approach to management problems.

- **[Brain of the Firm (1972 1st edition, 1981 2nd edition)](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=3E135C173CEBC928C9F5F5B5EF11C388)**

    - **Description:** Brain of the Firm develops an account of the firm based upon insights derived from the study of the human nervous system, and is a basic text from the author's theory of viable systems. Despite the neurophysiology, the book is written for managers to understand.

- *[Designing Freedom (1974)](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=A69707B1EDAFFEAF06BDD7BA705A937D)*

    - **Description:** Based on the Massey Lectures, this book examines the reasons why the institutions of our society may well be failing, and opens a discussion as to what could be done. Drawing on the science of effective organization, which is his definition of cybernetics, Stafford Beer explains key cybernetic principles in words and pictures that all can understand. He concludes that our society commits more and more resources to plastering over the cracks in the system which simply reappear while freedom itself is increasingly eroded. The institutions must be redesigned, and returned to the people, to whom the scientific tools for doing this ought to belong.

- **[Platform for Change (1975)](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=E154B4E16A1FF4B1123AD7031429218C)**

    - **Description:** Concerned with the hope that our planet may yet remain viable and the human race survive, this highly original book contains 13 arguments for change which are linked by personal and deeper metalinguistic commentaries.

- Transit (1977 1st edition, 1983 2nd edition) [NO DOWNLOAD LINK -- Help us!]

- *[The Heart of Enterprise (1979)](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=92ECD5204D3592B93A617CE9105DB98C)*

    - **Description:** Addresses the nature of viable systems within any organization by creating a model out of a set of managerial principles (rather than using a neurocybernetic model). Declares that we need laws which govern the capacity of any enterprise to maintain independent existence. Packed with examples from management practice.

- *[Diagnosing the System for Organisations (1985)](https://b-ok.cc/book/17227256/5ff9ce) [(awkward alternative scan)](https://b-ok.cc/book/2172261/a5e920)*

    - **Description:** A ground-breaking approach to organizational structure that uses cybernetics--the science of communication and control within systems--to solve inevitable organization and structural problems that occur in business environments.

- *[Pebbles to Computer: The Thread (1985)](http://library.lol/main/D00A22FD820732DD111AE85784ECBFD6)*

    - **Description:** Using an exciting synthesis of text and pictures, photographer Hans Blohm and scientist Stafford Beers present a graphic exploration of the connections between prehistoric and antique technologies and those of our modern world. In this inventive book, a Byzantine sun-dial and a modern satellite signal receiver are among the many images that have been chosen to show the 'thread' connecting our efforts down the ages to use and record information.

- **[Beyond Dispute: The invention of Team Syntegrity (1994)](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/3355083/mod_resource/content/1/Stafford%20Beer_Beyond%20Dispute.pdf)**

    - **Description:** The arguments in this fascinating, interdisciplinary book are wide-ranging, running the gamut from company management to the nature of consciousness. The author discusses the theory of team syntegrity and the social technique of syntegration which works in practice, offering a potent management tool for developmental planning.

- **[How Many Grapes Went into the Wine: Stafford Beer on the Art and Science of Holisitic Management (1994)](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=F86C7BD439304BEA06C8131077C5D79E)**
